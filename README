xpress project is a mathematical expressions tests game.

The program will create the expression to be solved by the player.
Analyse the created expression to know every possible way of solution for it.
Present the expression to the player so he can choose the first operations to be solved
in a two step process where the player selects the operations and then pushes the "GO" button.
If every selected operation can be solved in a same solution posibilty:
   The game will then present the individual operations so the player can solve it.
When not:
   The game will alert that those operations can't be solved.
After the player solve the individual operations the game shows the new expression
and works recursively untill there are not operations left.

At this moment the game is intended to work with the basic "operations" only,
by that I mean: sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Every number in the game will be an integer.
